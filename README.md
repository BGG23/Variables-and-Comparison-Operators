## Task 2
### List all variables currently loaded in to memory. The noun within the cmdlet is “Variable”

· Get-Variable

---

## Task 3
### Multiple two Int variables together PowerShell can perform basic maths operators, such as “+”, “-“ and “*”

· $IntVar1 = 4

· $IntVar2 = 10

· $IntVar1 * $IntVar2

---

## Task 4
### First declare two Int variables. Then divided the first variable by the second and assign the result to a variable named $VariableResult The easiest way to do this is within the Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE) using multiple lines of code

· $IntVar3 = 10

· $IntVar4 = 2

· $VariableResult = $IntVar3 / $IntVar4

---

## Task 5
### Typecast a Variable as a “String” and assign it a value of 5 Remember to normal brackets [] rather than curly brackets {} when typecasting a variable

· [String]$TypecastVar = 5
